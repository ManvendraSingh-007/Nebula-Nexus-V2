Nebula Nexus version 2

using raw html css and js was getting difficult, for the very reason i shifted to react as it have the capability to render individual components rather than entire page
Fastapi was easy, managable and realient, but since i have upgraded the frontend - i feel like this time using something other than FastApi
So now im working with fiber framework in GO
